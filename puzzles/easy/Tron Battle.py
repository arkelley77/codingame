# Auto-generated code below aims at helping you parse

# In this game your are a program driving the legendary Tron light
# cycle and fighting against other programs on the game grid.
#
# The light cycle moves in straight lines and only turn in 90Â° angles while leaving a solid light ribbon in its wake.
# Each cycle and associated ribbon features a different color.
# Should a light cycle stop, hit a light ribbon or goes off the game grid it will be instantly deactivated.
#
# The last cycle in play wins the game. Your goal is to be the best program: once sent to the arena,
# programs will compete against each-others in battles gathering 2 to 4 cycles.
# The more battles you win, the better your rank will be.
