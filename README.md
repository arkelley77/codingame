This is a repository of every submission I currently have active on CodinGame.
Below is a list of programs that are in this repository but are not complete yet.
For puzzles, code golf, and optimization this means they don't get 100%.
For bot programming, this means I'm not happy with where they're at.

### Unfinished programs

# Puzzles
- [ ] Mars Lander 2 (`"puzzles/medium/Mars Lander 2.py"`)
